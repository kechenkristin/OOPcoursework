## About The Project

### Overall Description
A back-end Java package provides functionality, data structure, general interface and user API for a cycling system (which has the same structure and rules as the famous cycling Grand Tours).

This project is a real world scale project, thus has a real industrial level devolopment procedure.
Using Design by Contract software design. 
Implementing full functionality for the interface provided by the client, making usage of Assertion and Exception to support a correct and robust program.
For the devoloping part, utilizing java's OOP features, encapsulating and abstracting real word stuffs into the design of java objects. Utilizing of java collection framework, choosing suitable java built-in data structure to support the build of each specific classes in order to meet the real world application and user's demands and needs, thus provides descent functionality.
As an industrial-grade project, the package also provides Javadoc and detailed API, abstracting functionality at a high level for clients to read and use. And all the stuffs are enclosured in a jar file, which also makes it easy to download and use.

### Mini Specification
A staged race is a type of cycling race that is distributed over multiple stages raced in different days. There
are also multiple competitions co-occurring in a staged race. For simplicity, the club decided to have only three
competitions within races. They are listed below, sorted by importance:
1. General Classification (GC) – this is the most important prize of the race. The winner is the rider who
finishes all stages in the least amount of time in total. Note, this rider may never win a single stage, but still be
the fastest when one aggregates the overall times.
2. Points (Sprinter’s) Classification – in this classification the actual time is not considered, but the ranks of
riders. Finishing a stage in the top ranks give riders a certain amount of points depending on the type of the
stage. In addition to the finish line points, stages can have intermediate sprints. These sprints act as intermediate
finish lines and riders get points according to their position crossing them. The winner in the points classification

is the rider who sums the most points after all stages in a race. See points distribution in Figure 1.
3. Mountain Classification – is a special competition which prizes the best climbers in the peloton. Similar
to the sprinter’s classification, mountain points are given to riders who first reach the summit of mountains
throughout stages. As expected, tougher climbs worth more points. At the end of the race, the King of the
Mountains (KOM) is the rider who collects the most of the mountain points. 

The system has three parts:
1. Riders Management – the system is able to manage riders and teams.
2. Race Design – the system have functionalities to allow the creation of stage races. That is, user can
be able to manage stages within races and configure them. Among the configurations, for instance, as well as define intermediate sprints and mountain summits.
3. Race Results – the system have functionalities to handle the realization of races following the specified design. In other words, the system allow recording the results of riders on races.
